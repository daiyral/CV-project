## Description
This project..

## Project steps:
1. aaa
2. bbb

## Solution Approach:
### Reducing Points Based on Opacity Levels:
Since the object (a car) contrasts with the white background, we can filter out points with low opacity that likely belong to the background.
By eliminating these outliers, we focus on higher-quality data that better represents the object.
This preprocessing step helps the model learn from more relevant and accurate data, improving its overall performance.

#### With opacity=0:
